SL(1): Cure your bad habit of mistyping
=======================================

SL (~~Steam Locomotive~~ Skoda Lurks) runs across your terminal when you type "sl" as
you meant to type "ls". It's just a joke command, and not useful at
all.

# Update notes for cat version

This is Skoda:

and she lurks.

## How to run

Skoda is hidden under flag -C, so, to enjoy unexpected lurking, add alias:

```alias sl="sl -C"```
